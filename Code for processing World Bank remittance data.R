##### Merge with location data #####

##### Make binary for whether any remittances received #####
# This is combining across source (same-HH, non-HH) and type (money or goods)

  select(house, curr_money, curr_goods, nothh_money, nothh_goods)

bur1b$cts <- rowSums(bur1b[ , 2:5], na.rm = T) # Since these are all binary, it's okay to sum

baggs <- aggregate(bur1b$cts, by = list(bur1b$house),function(x){ifelse(sum (x) > 0, 1, 0)}) # Record to binary

baggs <- data.frame(house = baggs$Group.1, remit = baggs$x) # Aggregate creates annoying dataframes (still useful function though!), so rename that messy dataframe

bur1c <- bur1a %>% #Go back to original data before this little sideshow aggregate thing; get rid of all columns except HH ID and location.
  select(house, lat, long) %>% 
  distinct(house, .keep_all = T)

bur2 <- inner_join(bur1c, baggs) #Merge with remittance presence/absence data.


##### Output #####
