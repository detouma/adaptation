# adaptation
Code submitted with Pisor et al. to One Earth.<br>
Script by Danielle Touma (detouma@ucar.edu).<br>
This Jupyter Notebook script shows an example workflow of identifying and characterizing climate extremes in an observational dataset, processing adaptation data, and taking a first step in relating the two datasets.<br>
It relies on having data downloaded locally to your machine, but is adaptable to work in the cloud or on a cluster.<br>
Depending on the datasets, you may require ~80GB of RAM. This can be greatly reduced by subsetting for space or time, or using a coarser resolution dataset.
