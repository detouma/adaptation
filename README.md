# adaptation
Code submitted with Pisor et al. to One Earth. Scripts by Danielle Touma (detouma@ucar.edu).
This Jupyter Notebook script shows an example workflow of identifying and characterizing climate extremes in an observational dataset, processing adaptation data, and taking a first step in relating the two datasets.
The notebook is thoroughly commented.
It relies on having data downloaded locally to your machine, but is adaptable to work in the cloud or on a cluster. Depending on the datasets, you may require ~80GB of RAM. This can be greatly reduced by subsetting for space or time, or using a coarser resolution dataset.
